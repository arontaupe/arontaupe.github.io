# Ballpark
## 3D Environments in Unity

Implemented in Unity, Ballpark is a Conceptwork for a collaborative 2-Player Game, where one player is a navigator with a third-person perspective and another player is copilot, responsible for interaction with the environment â€“ featuring mostly working physics, intelligent enemies, a gun, a grappling hook system for traversing the map, a 2D Interface for navigation and a healthbar system. On top the meanest cyberpunk vibes my past self was able to conjure.

Enjoy!

As you can see, the design faces some questionable choices, but all mechanics are homemade from the ground up and I learned a lot. I often struggle enjoying competitive games and really think there is potential in a co-dependent game interface. During early testing, we often found that it really enforces player communication, since already the tutorial is quite hard to beat.
